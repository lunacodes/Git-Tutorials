For Git Beginners, because Git can be Beyond Confusing when you first start:

    Make A Repository in Github.com - Name it whatever you want

    On your computer, create a New Folder & add your files to it (or create them in this folder)


Then Follow These Steps:

    git init                                    Initializes Git (Tracker)

    git add filename                            Adds File to the Tracker

    git status -v                               Check that the files have been added & their Commit Status (they haven't been committed yet)

    git commit -am "First Commit"               Puts the current version of the file in the tracker.  a stands for "All".  m stands for "Message".  Follow this flag with your "Message" in quotes.

    git remote add origin http://url.com        Creates the "Remote" (aka the URL of your Repository) so Git knows where to send your files.  Names it "Origin".  

    git remote -v                               Check that the Remote was added

    git pull origin master                      Grabs the Files from the Repo - You need to do this before you can Push

    git push origin master                      Pushes (Sends) the files to the Remote's Origin on the Master Branch



To make a copy of someone's code:
    git clone http://url.com                        Clone the contents of an Existing Repo


Notes:

    In the future, you should git pull origin master prior to the other steps
    You can have multiple Remotes & choose which one to send them to when you push/pull
